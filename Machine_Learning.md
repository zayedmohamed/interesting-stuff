### Videos
- Series of videos that explain Deep Learning Simply [DeepLearning.TV] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9OeZkIwhzfv-_Cb7fCikLQ/videos)

### Tutorials 
This tutorial contains interactive explanation of the functionality and structure of Convolutional Neural Network. It also demonstrates the Convolunational Neural Network through an interactive workout example.
- Interactive Explanation of the Basics of Convolutional Neural Network [Part (1)] (https://youtu.be/WXqSNuTiEEg)
- Demonstration of the Convolunational Neural Network through an interactive workout example [Part (2)] (https://youtu.be/L1F1E5UTSCo)

## Recurrent Neural Networks
- The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks [here] (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). You can train your own models using the [char-rnn code] (https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) I released on Github (under MIT license). It is worth to say at this level that there is a keras implementation of text generation [here] (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py)

## Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks
- Semantic Image Segmentation [demo](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~szheng/crfasrnndemo) and the code is in this [github](https://github.com/torrvision/crfasrnn)

## Spatial Transformer Networks
- The power of Spatial Transformer Networks [here](http://torch.ch/blog/2015/09/07/spatial_transformers.html). The code to reproduce same results or even get better is [here](https://github.com/moodstocks/gtsrb.torch) ones: they provide a fancy way to [mass benchmark] (https://github.com/Moodstocks/gtsrb.torch/blob/master/docs/bench.md) configurations to help you do that.
